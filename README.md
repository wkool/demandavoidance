Tasks for "Decision making and the avoidance of cognitive demand"

The Demand Selection Task (DST) provided in the folder dst_multidecks corresponds to Experiment 3 of Kool, McGuire, Rosen, & Botvinick (2010). This code has been written by <b>Joseph T. McGuire</b> (http://sites.bu.edu/cdlab/).

A copy of MATLAB and Psychtoolbox (http://psychtoolbox.org/) are needed to run this study.

We recommend using this version of the DST, since it minimizes the influence of non-demand-related preferences on the average low-demand choice rate.
